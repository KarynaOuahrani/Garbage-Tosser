# Garbage-Tosser
 The main part of the game: the user sees a simple casual game. At the beginning of the game, the user sees only the background and tree baskets with three types of garbage(plastic, paper and organic garbage). Next, the user sees three types of garbage falling from the top of the screen to the central garbage in random order. If plastic falls first, using the computer mouse the user click on the basket with the plastic. In this way we put the plastic in our basket. Over time, the garbage falling from above accelerates, so the game become more difficult and it is easy for the user to lose at this point. If the center basket contains the wrong garbage, the user loses and the game closes.
